    <h2>Why Nine Districts?</h2>
    <p>The Nine Districts effort addresses four fundamental flaws in our County Council's at-large composition.</p>
    <h3>Removing the exclusion and discrimination</h3>
    <p>For 30 years, the County Council has consisted of nine members, five directly from districts and four members elected "at-large."</p>
      <p>In diverse jurisdictions such as Montgomery County, at-large representation leads to exclusion and discriminationâ€”and that's what's happening here. Currently, seven out of nine council members live in the "down-county crescent," and all four at-large council members live in that crescent. That means that decisions about public services, transportation, housing, development, and taxes are made by council members who live in an area with only 30% of the county population!</p>

    <h3>Reducing district size</h3>
    <p>Four of MoCo's five districts radiate from the densely populated south to the rural north. These districts fail the test of being compact or small, nor do they include similar communities or residents (which implies they are gerrymandered). The issues of concern to residents near Clarksburg, Olney, and Burtonsville are very different from those of residents who live in downtown Bethesda or Silver Spring.</p>
    

    <h3>Increasing council responsiveness</h3>
    <p>Today Montgomery County is home to more than 1.1 million residents living in rural, urban and suburban communities spread across 500 square miles.  Each of the five council district members represents more than 200,000 residents, and each at-large represents 1.1 million residents (your state and congressional representatives represent smaller numbers of residents). That many people per council district spread across a large area is too great for any Council member to adequately represent the many concerns of diverse residents with competing interests.</p>

    <h3>Reducing campaign costs</h3>
    <p>Currently, each district council member represents 220,000 residents, and each at-large council member represents 1.1 million residents. The cost of running these campaigns is high, more so for challengers than incumbents. Campaigning in nine smaller compact districts will be less costly for candidates, giving voters more of a voice and challengers a fairer chance of winning.</p>
