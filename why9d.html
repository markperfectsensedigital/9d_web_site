    <h2>Why Nine Districts?</h2>
    <p>Nine Districts for MoCo ballot committee was established in 2019 to promote passage of a ballot referendum to change the structure of the Montgomery County Council, the legislative body of the Montgomery County, MD government. The Nine Districts ballot initiative is a non-partisan citizens movement comprised of residents from all political parties and a wide geographic area in the county. We are focused exclusively on one issue: Fair representation on the County Council for residents living in all areas of the county.</p>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>Montgomery County, Maryland (MoCo) has outgrown its County Council structure. It is time to realign the Council so all residents&#8212;regardless of where they live&#8212;have a representative on the County Council.</p>
    <p>For 30 years, the County Council has consisted of nine members, five elected to represent five districts stretched across the county and four members elected "at-large."  This may have been a reasonable structure in 1990 when the population was some 700,000 residents concentrated down county. Since then the county has grown up county and has more than 1.1 million residents. Yet the structure of our county council has remained the same.</p>
    <p>Now is the time to bring the Council into the 21st century.  Please sign the Nine Districts for MoCo petition and allow Montgomery County to vote to create nine smaller and compact council districts that will better represent YOU!</p>

    <h3>Why is the County Council Structure Outdated and need of modernization? Why now?</h3>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">There are Too Many Residents in each Council District which Means Your Voice is DILUTED.</p>
    <p>It is no wonder that many MoCo residents feel like they are not "heard" by our elected officials. Today Montgomery County is home to more than 1.1 million residents living in rural, urban and suburban communities spread across 500 square miles.  Each of the five council district members represents more than 200,000 residents. That many people per council district spread across a large area is too great for any Council member to adequately represent the many concerns of diverse residents with competing interests.</p>
    <p>At-large seats may have served a purpose when the county's population was much smaller and homogeneous. Today, each of the four at-large member is responsible for knowing and engaging with all 1.1 million county residents&#8212;more constituents than a Maryland Congressional district. Each of Maryland's Congressional districts is comprised of some 750,000 residents.</p>
    <p>By creating NINE district-specific Council seats and eliminating all four at-large Council seats, YOUR Council member will actually represent fewer people and give you a stronger voice in the County decisions. And isn't a stronger voice something we all want!</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold">Over representation of residents in one geographic area is UNFAIR!</p>
    <p>Today 7 of 9 Council members live south of Rockville. The result? County legislative decisions are made by representatives from a small area called the "down county crescent." A majority of Council members (and the County Executive) live in Silver Spring and Takoma Park. That means that decisions about public services, transportation, housing, development, and taxes are made by Council members who live in an area with only 30% of the county population!</p>
    <p>Residents outside the "down county crescent" are under-represented and that is UNFAIR. The current structure fails to provide adequate proportional representation from a geographic standpoint for residents and communities in northern and western parts of Montgomery County. This geographic over-representation and the lack of proportional representation can be fixed by creating nine smaller, compact and similar districts.</p>


    <p class="font-weight-bold">The current five Council districts are not compact and force dissimilar communities to have one Council representative.</p>
    <p>At present Council District 1 encompasses downtown Bethesda/Chevy Chase, and stretches northward to include Poolesville and Boyds all the way to the Frederick County border. As a reference point that is the full length of Interstate 270 in the county. Council District 4 includes areas of Wheaton and Silver Spring and reaches north to include Olney and Laytonsville along the eastern Howard County border.</p>
    <p>Clearly, these districts fail the test of being compact or small, nor do they include similar communities or residents.  The issues of concern to residents near Clarksburg are very different from those of residents who live in downtown Bethesda or Silver Spring. </p>
    <p>Creating nine smaller, compact districts that represent communities of similar type and geography will ensure that all neighborhoods in the county are EQUALLY represented!</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold">High cost of running for Council at-large or to represent a large district discourages less established and non-major party candidates.</p>
    <p>At present it is very costly for candidates to run for a Council district seat, either an at-large seat or one of the 5 district seats. A change to nine smaller compact districts will be less costly for candidates as there will be less geography to cover and fewer voters to contact. That gives VOTERS MORE of a voice and SPECIAL INTERESTS LESS power!</p>
    <p>Under our current Council structure it is a particular burden for new and less established candidates to run a successful campaign. This should not be the case in nine smaller compact districts.</p>
    <p>Eliminating the at-large seats will likely save county expenses for the new Public Election Fund (PEF) because candidates for at-large Council seats&#8212;if they qualify for PEF funding&#8212;receive much higher matching fund payouts of than candidates who run for district-specific seats.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold">None of the Above Represents You</p>
    <p>The current County Council structure is a convenient way for the County Council&#8212;district members and at-large members together&#8212;to ignore unique resident concerns. You cannot get the attention of your district Council member because their focus is diverted by many other concerns of other communities entirely different from yours. At-large Council members must get permission from the district Council member to engage with you to take any action to help you.</p>
    <p>MoCo should have a County Council with members who focus on concerns that matter to residents in their smaller and compact districts. We need an elected Council accountable to each of us, our district, and to the issues of concern in our district. Nine individual districts that are smaller, compact and with similar communities will make it easier for Council members to represent us and it will encourage Council members to work together (especially those who represent contiguous districts) on common solutions for us rather than working on whatever they choose under the current outdated structure.</p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">NOW is the time to realign the Council structure because of the upcoming 2020 Census</p>
    <p>MoCo Council district lines will be redrawn after the 2020 decennial census, and will become effective in time for the next Council election in 2022. That means 2020 is the optimal time to eliminate the four at-large Council seats with a commensurate expansion of district-seats from 5 to a total of 9. Montgomery County will continue to grow. Now is the time to change the structure of the County Council for the 21st Century.</p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">This is a non-partisan effort.</p>
    <p>The residents promoting this ballot referendum come from all political parties and a wide geographic area in the county. This effort is about democratizing the County Council, and about diluting power and special and geographic interests. </p>
