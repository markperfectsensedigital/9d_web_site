    <h2>Why Nine Districts?</h2>
    <p>Montgomery County has outgrown its County Council. It is time to realign the Council so all residents -- regardless of where they live -- have a representative on the County Council.</p>

    <p>The current County Council is comprised of five district representatives and four at-large representatives. This may have been a reasonable structure in 1990 when the population was some 700,000 residents concentrated down county. Since then our population has grown up county and there are more than 1.1 million residents.</p>
    <p><strong>Today 7 of 9 Council members live south and east of North Bethesda. </strong> The result? County legislative decisions are made by representatives from a small area called the “down county crescent.” A majority of Council members (and the County Executive) live in Silver Spring and Takoma Park.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold">That means decisions about your public services, transportation, housing, development, and taxes are made by Council members from an area with only 30% of county population!</p>
    <p>The current structure makes it impossible for individual residents to be heard, so special interests dominate.</p>
    <p>Increasing the number of Council districts to nine, and abolishing the at-large seats, will guarantee smaller districts, more responsive representation, and an avenue for <strong>your voice to be heard</strong>.</p>


    <p><strong>Why now?</strong> District boundaries drawn after the 2020 Census will be in place for ten years. Now is the time to demand nine compact districts. All residents deserve a district representative on the Montgomery County Council.</p>
