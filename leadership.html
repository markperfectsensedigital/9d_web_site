    <h3>Mark Lautman</h3>
    <div class="col-md-12">

      <p>Mark moved to Montgomery County in 1998, and has been working in the region's high-tech industry since that time. Like many local high-tech workers, he knows that there are precious few jobs in Montgomery County in general and in high-tech in particular, so he is one of tens of thousands of workers who daily finds employment in DC or Northern Virginia. To get to those jobs, he and his fellow long-distance commuters travel one hour each way (for those living in down county), and two hours each way (for those living in Germantown, Clarksburg, Olney, and points north).</p>

      <p>Mark started his journey toward local politics about two years ago when Loudoun County in Northern Virginia proposed constructing a second Potomac River Crossing that would extend into Montgomery County. The County Council's reaction was swift and unanimous: nope. Mark wrote to every council member asking them to reconsider, and received a response from the council's then-president that MoCo's vision stipulates that the state government should expand the American Legion Bridge. Even though MoCo could build a second Potomac River crossing entirely within its jurisdiction, reduce the commute times to places where there are jobs (because there are no jobs in MoCo), relieve the stress and tension that 200,000 drivers feel daily as they cross the bridge and crawl up the I-270, and reduce the concomitant pollution, the council unanimously believed (and still believes) that they have no responsibility for the commuters' welfare beyond deflecting requests to Annapolis.</p>

      <p>That's when he realized that something is terribly wrong in MoCo. People living inside the down-county crescent have Metro, the Purple Line, the high-capacity highways, and the alternative routes. The high-tech commuters (and anyone living outside the crescent) have to appeal to officials in Annapolis for relief, because there is no-one on the County Council taking an interest in their welfare. The council and its executives have spent decades fostering a policy of no jobs and no transportation to get to where the jobs are. That may be a fine arrangement for some, but surely the 70% of the population who live outside the down-county crescent, and who are severely impacted by this policy, should get 70% of the voting rights to either ratify this situation or change it.</p>

      <p>Working on Nine Districts has been very rewarding for Mark. The steering committee is comprised of Democrats, Republicans, and the unaffiliated. They all place their differences aside to focus on this one goal that serves every single resident's interest, regardless of party affiliation, demographic, or home address.</p>
      
      <p>"The best days," says Mark, "are when I'm out collecting signatures for our petition, and someone says, 'Thank you for doing this.'"</p>
