      <p>Kimblyn Persaud has lived in Montgomery County for more than twenty-five years, with 16 of those years in Wheaton. She lives by the motto "The service we render others is the rent we pay for our room on earth"&mdash;Sir Wilfred Thomason Grenfell, Missionary Medical Doctor.</p>
      
      <p>This belief and focus on community has led her to numerous volunteer opportunities and community leadership roles. She has served the Wheaton community as President of the Wheaton Regional Park Neighborhood Association, and Co-founder of Save the Wheaton Library, and Co-founder of the Wheaton Coalition. She was a member of The League of Women Voters, the Zoning Advisory Panel as a Community Representative, and the Junior League of Washington, DC. She's currently a member of the Women's Democratic Club and Chair of the non-partisan ballot initiative Nine Districts for MoCo.</p>
<p>As a community activist living in an underserved immigrant community, Kim Persaud has had a front row seat on how laws passed by the County Council have negatively affected everyone's quality of life. She has witnessed how overcrowded housing leads to rat and roach infestation for a whole community and how unsafe living conditions and illegal parking spill over to unsafe streets.  She realized that these concerns were falling on deaf ears which lead her to work on the Term Limits ballot initiative, which passed overwhelmingly in 2016.</p>
<p>In 2019, Kim was told that in order to get the traffic control, HAWK beacon at Georgia Avenue. and Price Street. in Downtown Wheaton, it would require the installation of a 6ft black fence similar to many going up in low income, immigrant communities. The community had not been told of this decision or been asked for input, and the State and the County officials weren't interested in the community's feelings or opinions. Yet, down the road in downtown Silver Spring, the Park and Planning, State Highway Administration, Montgomery County Department of Transportation officials and their architects were actively engaging that community in decisions to put up attractive and safe pedestrian barriers. This is what it looks like, to be told you don't count!</p>
<p>Knowing what it's like to not have a seat at the table is what drove Kim Persaud to Chair Nine Districts for MoCo, a non-partisan effort to create nine smaller Council districts, giving everyone in Montgomery County an opportunity to be heard and to hold their Council member  accountable, regardless of the zip code you live in.</p>

    <h3>Mark Lautman, Treasurer</h3>
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <div class="pull-left"><img src="images/ml-photo.jpg" class="float-left mr-3" alt="mark lautman head shot" /></div>

      <p>Mark Lautman moved to Montgomery County in 1998, and has been working in the region's high-tech industry since that time. Like many local high-tech workers, he knows that there are precious few jobs in Montgomery County in general and in high-tech in particular, so he is one of tens of thousands of workers who daily finds employment in DC or Northern Virginia. To get to those jobs, he and his fellow long-distance commuters travel one hour each way (for those living in down county), and two hours each way (for those living in Germantown, Clarksburg, Olney, and points north).</p>

      <p>Mark started his journey toward local politics about two years ago when Loudoun County in Northern Virginia proposed constructing a second Potomac River Crossing that would extend into Montgomery County. The County Council's reaction was swift and unanimous: nope. Mark wrote to every council member asking them to reconsider, and received a response from the council's then-president that MoCo's vision stipulates that the state government should expand the American Legion Bridge. Even though MoCo could build a second Potomac River crossing entirely within its jurisdiction, reduce the commute times to places where there are jobs (because there are no jobs in MoCo), relieve the stress and tension that 200,000 drivers feel daily as they cross the bridge and crawl up the I-270, and reduce the concomitant pollution, the council unanimously believed (and still believes) that they have no responsibility for the commuters' welfare beyond deflecting requests to Annapolis.</p>

      <p>That's when Mark realized that something is terribly wrong in MoCo. People living inside the down-county crescent have Metro, the Purple Line, the high-capacity highways, and alternative routes. The high-tech commuters (and anyone living north of the crescent) have no-one on the County Council taking an interest in their welfare. The council and our county executives have spent decades fostering a policy of no jobs and no traffic congestion help for us to get to where the jobs are. That may be a fine arrangement for some, but surely the 70% of the population who live outside the down-county crescent, and who are severely impacted by this policy, should get 70% of the voting rights to either ratify this situation or change it.</p>

      <p>Working on the nonpartisan Nine Districts ballot referendum has been very rewarding for Mark. Its steering committee is comprised of Democrats, Republicans, and the unaffiliated. They all place their differences aside to focus on this one goal for fair representation that serves every single resident's interest, regardless of party affiliation, demographic, or home address.</p>
      
      <p>"The best days," says Mark, "are when I'm out collecting signatures for our petition, and someone says, 'Thank you for doing this.'"</p>
